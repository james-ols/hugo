The new website has been created by Orangeleaf Systems - with the assistance of a grant from the Museums Federation - and contains a number of pages in the Welsh language. “We believe we are the first sporting organization in Wales to have a bilingual website celebrating the history of the game,” said Andrew Hignell, the Curator of the Museum who, together with a team of volunteers, has  overseen the creation of the website. 

> “Our new website also has links to our social media activities, including the very popular podcasts which have showcased the work of the Museum over the past twelve months or so. The COVID pandemic has led to new and different working patterns so, having realized the importance of having a strong virtual presence, we are very grateful to the Museums Federation for their generous financial assistance which has allowed the creation of a very attractive and dynamic website with a host of new features.”

These include a series of special maps showing the locations in Wales where cricket was played during the nineteenth century as well as a series of pages outlining the history of the game in the Principality with notes and photographs about some of the key people  and landmark moments in cricket’s evolution in Wales. There is also a section celebrating the diverse range of people involved in Welsh cricket, as well as another section remembering cricket during the two World Wars plus a photo gallery of  cricket pavilions. 

There is detailed information as well about the Museum’s collection, including a searchable database, created with the help of the MODES software. Links have also been created to the Museum’s blog as well as the photographic collection held in the People’s Collection Wales. A research toolkit has also been created to assist users in finding out more about their own club’s history as well as some helpful tips on how to use the historical sources.
