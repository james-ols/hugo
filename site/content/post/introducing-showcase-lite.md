We are pleased to be able to offer a new, next generation interface for CollectionsBase.  Over the past few months, we've been developing a new lightweight javascript framework based user interface that 
has the same functionality as our main WordPress based collections search plugin.  The search has both list, grid, map and timeline layouts of results, with a facet refinement and filtering panel.
We are providing IIIF based support using both OpenSeadragon and optionally Universal Viewer, and we have a connector to Preservica API for digital surrogates.
By utilising a 'serverless' cloud deployment process, we can provide a hugely scalable and accessible load balanced collections search website, whilst still leveraging our own core CollectionsBase API for uploading CALM, Axiell Collections,
Modes, Mimsy, AtoM, Arches and Adlib based data.
We are using a 'headless' Content Management System based approach for menus, posts, pages, boxes, exhibits and object of the day by using a customised version of Laravel Twill, with content API cached and distributed by CloudFlare to offer huge resilience.
We are doing our final user trials, please contact us for more details and pricing.
