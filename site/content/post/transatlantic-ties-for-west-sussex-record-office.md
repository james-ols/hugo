  We are pleased to launch a new website for the Transatlantic Ties project, a
  Mellon Foundation funded learning and outreach project which aimed to explore
  and raise awareness of the shared history of West Sussex and the United States
  through a wealth of resources in the Countyâ€™s archives.

The [new Transatlantic Ties web site](https://www.transatlantic-ties.org.uk/) runs on our CollectionsBase Museum and Archives platform, using WordPress as its base.  It features a "subject specific index locked" search over Axiell CALM records as part of our larger CALM data set for all of West Sussex Record Office.  It provides full IIIF service for digital surrogates including large volume scanned sets, presented through Universal Viewer.  

We are pleased to showcase our new CollectionsBase Exhibit interface functionality, using Open Seadragon and Annotorious. The team annotated the manuscript copy of the declaration, hosted on our IIIF service, using [Recogito](https://recogito.pelagios.org/) and we would like to thank Rainer Simon for his help and support in assisting us in integrating Recogito into our WordPress / CollectionsBase functionality.

The site features 3D scanned objects (by Max Communications) from Royal Sussex Regiment, as well as an integrated content driven map service for West Sussex Places using our CollectionsBase Authority File import for WordPress plugin, with map by MapTiler from Klokan.
