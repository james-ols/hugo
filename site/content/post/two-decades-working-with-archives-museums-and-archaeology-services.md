Our very first project was the design and development of a Museum Collection website for Shrewsbury Museum : Darwin Country, which still remains today!

We’ve become specialised in the connection to all the many varied Collection Management Systems, transforming and crosswalking the data within them using Heritage Standards such as ISAD(G)/ EAD, SPECTRUM, MIDAS, CIDOC CRM and Dublin Core.

Over the years, we’ve used those skills to create unique cross sector public access web applications for small museums up to large National and International organisations.

We’ve produced the UK’s largest joint aggregration across services called CollectionsBase.  We host at scale:  we were there for the Postal Museum when it came to launch Mail Rail, with the website receiving 850 concurrent users a second at one point.

We’ve built some amazing things, including the only end-to-end Archive specific CRM solution using Zebra hardware for barcode based production document movement control, reader ticket printing with handheld scanners.

We provide high level consultancy to local and national government organisations and can provide impartial advice regards Collection Management Systems and solutions.
