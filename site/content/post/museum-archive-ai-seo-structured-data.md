title: SEO for AI and Museum and Archive AI Structured Data

description: >-
    Over the past few months we have been working on a CollectionsBase Museums and Archives platform solution to support search engine optimisation for the AI crawlers and bots of OpenAI, Anthropic and Google.

Our solution comprises two parts: the generation of a specially structured data response that we have discovered that works best from our CollectionsBase API (Application Programming Interface) within a search context, and control of the bots to guide them to this specialised
contextual information about the museum object records and archive records.  Rather than block the bots entirely, we are working with them to present structured information for Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) via a load balanced caching
mechanism that prevents overload of our collections search websites.

We are working with our customers to determine how much of their collections information they want presented to the AI crawl bots, and we can still block them as required.
