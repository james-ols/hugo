We are pleased to launch the new website for [Surrey Archives](https://www.surreyarchives.org.uk).

The new site uses the existing CALM based collection datasets loaded to our CollectionsBase platform for Archives and Museums, which for the past decade has delivered Exploring Surrey’s Past. Delivering on the strategy of Create Once, Publish Everywhere (COPE) , the new Surrey Archives replacing the old CalmView is actually a ‘filtered’ search of the whole ESP set, just searching within Surrey’s Collection.

We have combined the CALM record search results with an e-commerce shop using WooCommerce, with integration with WorldPay and SAP to provide a one click solution for reprographics and copying requests and payments, as well as product sales.
