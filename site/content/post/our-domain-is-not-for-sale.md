  Our domain being listed for sale is a scam.
---
This is notice that the domain name orangeleaf.com is wholly owned by Orangeleaf Systems Ltd since 29 October 1998 and is not, nor will it ever be, for sale to any third party.

Our domain is being fraudulently listed, along with many others, on some premium domain sales platforms by a known scammer.  Engaging in the buy now or bid process for our domain will mean you will be scammed and lose your money.

Thank you.

James Grimster
Founder, Orangeleaf Systems Ltd
