Offering both single day, and half day split sessions, the Orangeleaf Systems Reader Order Management software can be easily configured to set the exact number of socially distanced seats, and controls numbers by advance and in session document ordering.

Customisable in advance, with a control panel used by front of house staff during the day, the ROM simplifies the workflows for staff as the search rooms and heritage centres start to re-open to the public.
