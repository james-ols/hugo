The [new website](https://www.kentarchives.org.uk) uses our very latest CollectionsBase 7.1 catalogue search interface to search records held by the Archive in CALM.

The system is being launched in a number of phases.  Phase One comprises the ‘mobile first‘ catalogue search interface, with map search, image gallery and timeline search.  Phase One includes the Content Management System for research support and thematic content pages.

Next year brings e-commerce enabled reprographic quotation requests, digital downloads of Access Copies from the Digital Preservation system and full physical document ordering with real time document production tracking (Kent Archives has barcoded containers and shelves) using our Reader and Order Management System.
