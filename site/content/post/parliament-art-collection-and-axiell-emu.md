Developed over the spring and summer of 2021, [this bespoke website](https://heritagecollections.parliament.uk/) is within the Parliament brand and utilises our CollectionsBase museum platform and data pipeline process for search and display.  It features search refinement via facets and an OpenSeadragon based zooming image function.  The site also uses our CollectionsBase MyCollection functionality to allow researches to collect a basket of objects and produce an output report in PDF or CSV for further study.

The new site includes search support thesaurus integration with EMu managed terms and a vocabulary / ontology development service, as well as embedded schema.org metadata. 

This project uses CollectionsBase metadata repository in aggregation with UK Parliamentary Archives as we work towards a unified search API for Parliament.
