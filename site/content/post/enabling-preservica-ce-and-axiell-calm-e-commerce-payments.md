We've developed our newest version to enable County Record Offices using **Preservica Cloud Edition for Consortiums** solution to leverage their ongoing investment in Digital Preservation whilst still fully remaining in control using fine grained access managed through the cataloguing system they are used to, Axiell CALM.  

Our ROM product is **unique** in that it is fully compliant and tested with the two most used council payment gateways:  **Civica ICON and Capita Pay360**.  We support extended ledger codes and narration into both Oracle and SAP finance systems.

Archivists are in complete control of pricing rules using CALM, with access representations managed through Preservica with a choice of download or in browser viewing using our own IIIF platform  We support both single asset and delivery of Preservica Structural Objects to the customer.  Our delivery and render platform has full analytical tracking using either Google or Matamo to provide conversion reports from wish list to payment.

Our ROM is completely self-service, with Readers registering and managing their own accounts, without the need for staff to register an account and includes a secure message facility for support.  Our ROM CRM includes lost password, and staff enabled search room management of Reader accounts.

In addition, another unique feature of our ROM is the concept of Virtual and Physical reader.  A virtual remote user can be charged for access to a born digital asset however our solution can be configured to the council network to enable Readers physically in the search room on site at the archive to be given free access to the asset.

Our approach to metadata standards and use of a distributed repository approach means we can also provide the same functionality with other archive cataloguing systems, including Axiell Collections, AtoM, and Modes.
