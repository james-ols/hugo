  and Museum collections has now become.

The beginning of 2021 has seen a huge rise in the number of people accessing our regional museum and archive projects, especially those with our reprographics request system for digitisation on demand.

We've launched new [local museum Whitchurch](https://www.whitchurch-heritage.co.uk/) who use Modes through our 15 year long originally HLF funded Discover Shropshire aggregation project which is still going strong.

We've relaunched [Black Country History](https://www.blackcountryhistory.org/), the regional aggregation of 8 CALM users' catalogues.

We are launching, in both Welsh and English a new county aggregation for Monmouthshire County Council MonLife Heritage across 4 bilingual Modes collections.

We are launching a new website for long standing customer Doncaster Council for the fantastic new DANUM museum, library and gallery utilising our multiple Modes and CALM aggregation.

We are launching a new collections search website for Modes user Tamworth Castle and their amazing collection - currently being photographed.

Work progresses on our biggest project, for our National collection (to be announced soon).

The huge value of online access to collections is now being seen at executive level by organisations large and small, and we are already booking in large developments of our Archives CRM / document ordering and movement control system into 2022.

It's already an overused term, but these really are unprecedented times for the digital heritage industry - the likes I've not seen for 20 years in this business.
