## Welsh and English accessible system

The website and reader and order management solution is fully localised into Welsh to meet Welsh Government requirements as well as WCAG 2.1 AA.

The solution features an online shop connecting to the joint service payment gateway provided through Capita SCP web services platform.  The shop is used for both publications and research and reprographics.

We have also supplied to NEWA our leading software solution : Reader and Order Management.  This provides a dynamic management of the search rooms at Denbighshire and Flintshire, with booking in advance of documents selected from the catalogue search.  In addition to advance bookings, digital downloads by a pay per download is also provided for digitised materials.

Our solution is the only fully Welsh translated catalogue search and document ordering system available.
