  We are pleased to launch the new archives collection catalogue and service website for West Sussex Record Office on Sussex Day, 16th June 2024.

The [new web site](https://www.wsro.org.uk/) runs on the latest iteration of our CollectionsBase Museum and Archives platform, using WordPress as its base.  It also features our full Archives CMS: Reader Order Management solution with all its new functionality.  Our ROM solution now fully integrates with ARA Archives Card registration system, to allow direct single sign on from ARA Archives Card holders to WSRO.  The single sign on for ARA Archives card is unique, and the first platform to fully realise the Archives Card offer: centralised management of Readers across UK archives.  We'd like to thank ARA for allowing us to work with them and the iMIS developers on this.
We are also very pleased to announce our solution now fully supports Preservica Content API, including pay as you go delivery of complex Access Copy packages, with mixed form delivery.  Our solution provides the only commercially available functionality for connection to both Pay360 and Civica ICON Council payment gateways, to deliver digital archive packages to end users.  We have our own render system, to provide fully embedded delivery of assets with no dependencies on external systems.  We'd like to thank the develop:ment support team at Preservica, and WSRO's digital preservation manager for working hard on delivering this outcome for WSRO.
