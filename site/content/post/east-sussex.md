## Reader Software Infrastructure Outline

All document search functionality is provided by CollectionsBase.  All catalogues are virtualised into a common interchange so repositories can use multiple different collection management systems, or catalogues split across different databases.  The virtualised catalogue can hold Archive, Museum, Library, Local History and Archaeology data sets with different ordering business logic on a per catalogue type or per partner data set basis (producible only below certain level i.e File, or discrete CanBeOrdered flags). Location management metadata is harmonised into common container fields across the differing Collection Management Systems.

Entirely Web Service SaaS based product with plug-able front end ‘carts’ and ordering for WordPress, Joomla, Drupal or any Content Management System capable of communicating over SSL secured web services.  This can include mobile and touch table technologies too.

As each Archive will have different business logic please [contact us for a demonstration and quotation](/contact)
