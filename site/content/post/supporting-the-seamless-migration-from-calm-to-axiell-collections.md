  Our long term client Gwynedd Museums Service uses our CollectionsBase museum
  platform for their bilingual collections search across Storiel and Lloyd
  George collections.  By utilising our platform, they are able to swap from
  CALM to Axiell Collections without any rework needed to the collections search
  website.

Uniquely in the industry, CollectionsBase has an 'agnostic' approach to collections management systems through the use of a standards compliant interchange protocol.

Gwynedd Museums Service remapped from Axiell CALM to Axiell Collections, and all that was required from Orangeleaf Systems was a new ingress pipeline - everything else stays the same, and the curator could reload records as necessary to update the [collections site](https://collections.storiel.cymru/).
