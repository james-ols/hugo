  2026 sees a major update to our CollectionsBase solution supporting Epexio from Metadatis.
---
Over the past few months we have been working with Metadatis to bring Epexio into our CollectionsBase solution.  We are excited to be able to support this new archives collection management platform within our processes.

For customers who are in regional aggregation projects, where there are a number of different collection management systems, or for customers using our Capita payment gateway shop integration or Reader and Order Management CRM solution
we are providing our ingress pipeline configured for Epexio XML reports.  Epexio can provide reports based on Created and Modified dates, so this is an ideal solution for customers who want to migrate to Epexio, whilst still maintaining their
front end publishing process with WordPress, historic mapping and shop setups.

We are also very excited to report that we've worked with the support of Metadatis to connect directly to the Epexio APIs.  Epexio uses the same technology as CollectionsBase to provide a Lucene syntax based search engine, so we have been able 
to create an interface layer for our plugin that maintains the same user interfaces as our CollectionsBase API connection.

For customers with a single repository who have switched to Epexio, we can simply update their Orangeleaf CollectionsBase plugin and select Epexio API as the connection type.
