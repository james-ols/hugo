      We help archivists from county record offices, business and institution
      archives solve the challenges of public access to catalogued material. 
      We've advised during service improvements and the building of new
      facilities, including planning, search room to production automation,
      barcoding, digitisation and digital preservation.  We've produced crowd
      source transcription systems, and deliver via our solutions full reader
      and document management and e-commerce controlled access to digital
      surrogates.

      We help curators wrangle the content from their collection management
      systems into web based search, including engaging interfaces for 2D and 3D
      objects.  We can provide impartial advice about all the different desktop,
      server, cloud and open source Collection Management Systems available.
