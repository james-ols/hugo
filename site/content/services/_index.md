      We help archivists from county record offices, business and institution
      archives solve the challenges of public access to catalogued material.  We
      advise during service improvements and funding planning for new
      facilities, through to the production and supply of integrated end-to-end
      search room and document management solutions.

      We help curators wrangle the content from their collection management
      systems into web based search, including engaging interfaces for 2D and 3D
      objects.  We can provide impartial advice about all the different desktop,
      server, cloud and open source Collection Management Systems available.
