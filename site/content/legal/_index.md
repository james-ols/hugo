    IP addresses to protect our services, using both firewall and content
    delivery techniques.

    If you use our contact form, we ask you for your name and email address.  We
    store this information both on our database for the website, and also in our

    directly about your enquiry, and we do not pass these details to any third
    party.

    Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images,
    articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact
    same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

    These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional
    third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded
    content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you
    have an account and are logged in to that website.

    We use Matomo for visitor statistical analysis.  The last two octets 0.0.x.x
    of your IP address are obfuscated to anonymise your usage of our website.
