<h2>Who we are</h2>

<h2>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h2>
<h3>IP Address</h3>
<p>Your Internet Protocol Address is stored in our server logs during your use of our website, and for 30 days thereafter upon which it is deleted.  We use IP addresses to protect our services, using both firewall and content delivery techniques.  We do not cross reference your IP address to any other data, nor use it to determine who you are (reverse lookup or search).</p>
<h3>Names and Email Address</h3>
<p>If you use our contact form, we ask you for your name and email address.  We store this information both on our database for the website, and also in our receiving email program.  We will only use those details to contact you directly about your enquiry, and we do not pass these details to any third party.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>
<h3>Embedded content from other websites</h3>
<p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>
<p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>
<h3>Analytics</h3>
<p>We use Google Analytics to measure the usage of our website.  We retain usage statistics for one year.  Google Analytics does not allow us to personally identify you.  We use Piwik for additional statistical analysis.  The last two octets 0.0.x.x of your IP address are obfuscated to anonymize your usage of our website.</p>
<h2>Who we share your data with</h2>
<p>We do not share the name or email address or IP address of any user of our website with any third parties.</p>
<h2>How long we retain your data</h2>
<p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p>
<p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>
<h2>What rights you have over your data</h2>
<p>If you have left comments on this website, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>
<h2>Contact information</h2>
<p>To request your Personal Data we hold, or to request erasure of that Personal Data please email the Data Controller at:   privacy@orangeleaf.com</p>
<p>As an internet services supplier, we also develop, host and run many websites for our customers for whom we are Data Processors.  Should you wish to see what of your Personal data our Customers hold, or wish to have it erased, please use the contact details available on their website.  If you request such export or erasure service from us, we will immediately direct your enquiry to our Customer.</p>
