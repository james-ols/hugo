      The CollectionsBase repository.  Over two decades, we have created our
      XSLT based pipelines for: Modes, CALM, Adlib, EMu, MuseumPlus, Micromusee,
      HBSMR, ARCHES, AtoM and custom XML and SQL datastores.  With one click,
      the native export from these systems load into CollectionsBase.  No custom
      CSV required.  Our repository indexes and produces our APIs.
