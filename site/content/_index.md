      The CollectionsBase repository.  Over two decades, we have created our
      XSLT based pipelines for: Modes, CALM, Adlib, EMu, MuseumPlus, HBSMR, AtoM
      and custom XML and SQL datastores.  With one click, the native export from
      these systems load into CollectionsBase.  No custom CSV required.  Our
